About
-----

Apart from displaying text files in various formats, Aakash can play video and audio content.
A lot of content is available through projects such as NPTEL, Spoken Tutorials, Teachers' Training Workshops, etc..
Additionally, Wikipedia, Gutenberg project, Connexions project at Rice University, and many such global efforts have generated a large pool of knowledge content in Open Source. Such content can be kept either on a local Micro SD card storage of Aakash, or on a server accessible through Wi-Fi.

The efforts at IIT Bombay have been, to add more such content for use in Indian education system - to integrate these together in a better usable format - and to make these accessible using Aakash. Our 'Ek-Shiksha' project aims to provide quality content, originally available in English, translated for school students studying in local languages. 'Spoken Tutorial' project prepares 10 minute audio-tutorials. Educational animations have been prepared using the Open Source software Blender, under our 'Oscar' project. All such content is being modified for Aakash. For demonstration, we have included samples of some useful content prepared by these projects, a book from NCERT, and local language text books of Balbharati used in Maharashtra.

This application accesses such content located on an SD card, in .pdf, .html, or .mp3 formats. .
